# The Lazy Menu
I got this idea while searching google bored one weekend. What if there was a menu script to make the everyday boring useless tasks from common SR's we receive easier?
A quick and easy menu to go to for specific tasks like creating backend users?

This is just a quick and dirty prototype for now. But i'd like to add menu options for shutting down and bringing up domains, starting and stopping MQ and other common SE tasks.

Plz don't install this on anything if anyone comes across this. It hasn't been tested and kinda stinks right now.
